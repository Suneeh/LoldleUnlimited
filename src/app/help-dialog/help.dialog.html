  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Let's have an Example. Let's pretend the 1st guess was Zed.</p>
  <app-champion-guess [champ]="champService.getChampionByName('Zed')" [isDemo]="true" />
  <p>They year is too high, we need to get lower.</p>
  <app-champion-guess [champ]="champService.getChampionByName('Alistar')" [isDemo]="true" />
  <p
    >Now the year is too low. So it needs to be in between either 2010 or 2011. But the resource 'Mana' is correct. And Support seems to be
    somewhat close as well. Let's go with a female Supporter next.</p
  >
  <app-champion-guess [champ]="champService.getChampionByName('Leona')" [isDemo]="true" />
  <p
    >Okay, not it's clear. It is a 2010, Female, Mana user. She is played as a flex pick on Support and it seems like she is a human. I
    think I know it now.</p
  >
  <app-champion-guess [champ]="champService.getChampionByName('Lux')" [isDemo]="true" />
  <p>It was Lux the whole time! Got it? Try it out on your own now. Have fun!</p>
